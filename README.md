==========

You can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in [this repo](https://github.com/vicky002/Project_Solutions).

Before committing make sure you follow all the instructions properly.


- **Blocked Port By-Pass Application**: Apart from HTTP/HTTPS, all other ports are blocked. Our College LAN does not allow port 22 (SSH Port). Therefore, develop a tool that bypasses blocked port 22.

- **New Network Protocol**: UDP and TCP protocols have few problems/short-comings. Identify them and design your own Network Protocol.

- **TOR**: TOR is a very famous applications used in college/university by students for tunneling websites. Most of the college internet providers have even blocked TOR. So, build similar  application for tunneling and defend yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis. 

- **Chat Application using AJAX**

- **Lan Audio(Voice) Chat**: Can be easily implemented in Java with Java-net and Java Sample Audio API.

- **Group Chat in Java**: Again it's easy to implement. A basic knowledge of Concurrent Server will do.

- **Media Player in Java**:  Easy to implement. Thanks to Java Sample Sound/Audio API.

- **MP3 Extractor from you-Tube**

So, write a simple brute force program to generate permutations (possible passwords) and send it to command line, creating and running shell script. Run until you receive a success return call, that's it, the simple Zip Password Cracker Project is ready.

- **Create a Trojan Horse in C**: Again that's pretty easy. Run a simple C++ program on remote computer. Intelligently create a huge .dll file in SYS 32 directory and as an impact, eat the hard-disk space of victim's computer. Any Clean up software ignore .dll file, so the only solution is: Victims have to reformat the hard drive.

- **Simple C++ Key Logger Project** : A project that records the key strokes of PC and store it in intelligent way. Again, that can be easily done with Microsoft visual C++ SetWindowsHookEx  API.

- **Defect Tracking Tool** : Develop and application to track defects in different product and implement various defects and their analysis.

- **Search tool based on data-mining algorithm**: When you type the first letter in facebook search box, have you ever  noticed, the friend name whom you search frequently or with whom you interact mostly  in fb appears on the top of the suggestion box. That's because of highly efficient data-mining algorithm implemented by facebook. Develop similar tool and add few additional as well as custom features.
